* Test it with auxpow.py-based script.

* Test also submission of auxpow before auxpow start.

NOTE:  Auxpow as implemented leads to an "immediate softfork".  Old clients
will happily accept blocks with auxpow-version even if they do not have
an auxpow set.  The new client will only accept them after the auxpow start.
